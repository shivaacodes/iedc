              As we know, early stage funding is a big challenge for innovators, especially student 
              start-ups who are trying to commercialize innovative ideas. Understanding this 
              challenge, CUSAT has decided to set up a start-up fund with financial support from RUSA. 
              The fund is managed by CUSAT-TBI of CUSATECH FOUNDATION with the objective 
              of helping our students and researchers to convert their innovative ideas into full-fledged ventures. 
              RUSA also established a start-up incubation centre in CUSAT called RISE TBI(RUSA Innovation 
              Start-up Ecosystem Technology Business Incubator)
